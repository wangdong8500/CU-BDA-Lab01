My name is Dong Wang, I'm a PhD candidate in the department of Astronomy. I'm currently in my fourth year specializing in planetary science. 

Baysian methods have a lot of applications in astronomy. 
One thing that interests me is the analysis of Kepler transit data. These data are time series, containing  information on the radius of the planet and the atmospheric proeprties of the planet. I see a lot of results produced from Kepler light curves, and they have used Baysian methods. However, I don't know exactly how they did that. I hope I can get some insight from taking this class. 

Here is an image showing an example of the light curve. The downward spikes show the happening of transit, a result of the planet being in front of star blocking part of the starlight. The objective is to extract useful physical parameters.
